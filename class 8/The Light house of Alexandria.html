     <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria, or the Pharos, was a tall tower built between 285 and 247 BCE. It was built on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt to serve as a lighthouse for sailors. The top of the tower had a mirror that reflected sunlight during the day; a fire was lit at night.The Lighthouse of Alexandria is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World because of both the size and speed at which it was built. The tower stood at over 330 feet tall, which at the time of construction was the second tallest manmade structure in existence, apart from the pyramids of Giza.28
