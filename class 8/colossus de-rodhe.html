     <p>The Colossus of Rhodes was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It represented the god Helios, and was built to thank the gods for the victory over Demetrius Poliorcetes' long siege (305 BCE) of Rhodes. The Colossus of Rhodes is familiar to almost everyone.According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or 33 metres (108 feet) high – approximately the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown – making it the tallest statue in the ancient world.The statue, which took 12 years to build (c. 294–282 BCE), was toppled by an earthquake about 225/226 BCE. The fallen Colossus was left in place until 654 CE, when Arabian forces raided Rhodes and had the statue broken up and the bronze sold for scrap. Supposedly, the fragments totaled more than 900 camel loads.</p></div>
